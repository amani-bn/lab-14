`CREATE TABLE AUTHORS (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));` 
<!-- create another table in the lab14_normal database (copy one )named second table (authors) -->

`INSERT INTO authors(name) SELECT DISTINCT author FROM books;`
<!--  retrieve unique author from the books table and insert each one into the authors table in the (name) column. -->

`ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN author_id INT;`
<!--  add a column to the books table named author_id. This will connect each book to a specific author in the other table. -->

`UPDATE books SET author_id=author.id FROM (SELECT * FROM authors) AS author WHERE books.author = author.name;`
<!-- make a connection between the two tables.it will finds the author row that has a name matching the current book's author  -->

`ALTER TABLE books DROP COLUMN author;`
<!--  modify the books table by removing the column named author,he books table contains a author_id column which will become a foreign key, -->

`ALTER TABLE books ADD CONSTRAINT fk_authors FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(id);`
<!-- modify the data type of the author_id in the books table, setting it as a foreign key which references the primary key in the authors table. Now PostgreSQL knows HOW these 2 tables are connected. -->
